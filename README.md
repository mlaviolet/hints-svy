ABSTRACT: The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to collect nationally representative data about the American publicâ€™s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information. NCI provides supporting documentation and public-use data formatted for the proprietary systems SAS, SPSS, and Stata. The free, open-source R software has all functionality needed to analyze HINTS data, but NCI does not currently provide support for R users. This article demonstrates how R can be used to analyze HINTS data with examples drawn from HINTS documentation and published research.
